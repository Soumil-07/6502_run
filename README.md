# 6502_run

6502_run is a tiny 6502 emulator and debugger written in C.

## How to run

* Make sure you have [CMake](https://cmake.org) and a working C compiler installed.
* Create a build directory and run `cmake ..` with `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` for "debug" mode.
* Use a 6502 assembler (I test with [VASM](http://sun.hasenbraten.de/vasm/)) and run `./6502_run FILE` on a binary file generated by the assembler.
