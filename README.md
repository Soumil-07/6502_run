# 6502_run

6502_run is a tiny 6502 emulator and debugger written in C.

## How to run

* Make sure you have [CMake](https://cmake.org) and a working C compiler installed.
* Create a build directory and run `cmake ..` and `make`
* To run tests, ensure you have [libcheck](https://github.com/libcheck/check) installed. In Linux, you additionally require `pkg-config`.
* Use a 6502 assembler (I test with [VASM](http://sun.hasenbraten.de/vasm/)) and run `./6502_run FILE` on a binary file generated by the assembler, with an optional "-d" flag for running in debug mode (stepping through single clock cycles)
